## Welcome
Welcome!
In this workshop, you will scan and deploy an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) project to Amazon services using Snyk and HashiCorp terraform.  We'll use the CLI and web interfaces for these solutions to identify and fix issues.

## HashiCorp
HashiCorp enables organizations to deliver applications faster with a software stack offering consistent workflows to provision, secure, connect, and run any infrastructure for any application.

HashiCorp Terraform Cloud is the fastest way to adopt Terraform, the worldâ€™s most widely used multi-cloud provisioning product. Offered as a service, Terraform Cloud provides everything practitioners, teams, and global businesses need to create and collaborate on infrastructure and manage risks for security, compliance, and operational constraints. 

## Snyk
Snyk is a Cloud Native Application Security solution that enables developers and security teams to find and automatically fix vulnerabilities in your source code, Infrastructure as code templates, container images, kubernetes applications, and open source artifacts.
