# Snyk 

In this module, we get the code and run some CLI operations with Snyk to find misconfigurations in your Infrastructure as Code definitions.

We will perform these operations:

* Clone the respository
* Run a Snyk CLI scan and observe results
* Initialize the terraform environment, and re-run the Snyk scan to gather better context
* Fix an issue locally
* Send results to the Snyk Website
