# Introduction

## Learning objectives

This is a hands-on workshop that guides you through a set of examples familiar to the creation and deployment of cloud resources.  We're adding security scanning and fixing to the process as a new example for your workflow to show you that security does not have to be hard.

- Developers
- DevOps Engineers
- Solutions Architects
- Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)
- Anyone that wants to learn more!

## Workshop Structure

In this workshop, we'll perform activities related to the creation and deployment cloud resources managed by Infrastructure as Code.  

We'll scan those resources for vulnerabilities and fix them.  We'll observe exploits of these vulnerabilities in our running environment before and after we fix them.  The outline below summarizes what we'll be covering in this workshop.

**TODO** **REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.
