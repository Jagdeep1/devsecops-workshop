# Workshop Next Steps 

In the next sections, we'll configure tooling on your local environment.  The workshop is designed to run with a newly provisioned environment that does not include tooling.  The setup process for these clean environments is quick, and meant to ensure the entire workshop cohort starts with the same tooling and versions.  If you run from your own environment, you may already have these tools configured.
