# Workshop Prerequisites
We'll need to setup the following:

- Snyk Account
- Snyk CLI
- HashiCorp Terraform Cloud account
- HashiCorp terraform CLI

## Snyk Account and Snyk CLI
Your Snyk account allows you to scan your code to see results locally or on the Snyk website.  In this workshop we'll use both the CLI and Website.  You have the additional options of running Snyk within popular IDEs or programmatically with API calls, but those are not covered in this workshop.

## Terraform CLI
TODO: This paragraph block can optionally be utilized to lead into the next section of the workshop.

## HashiCorp Terraform Cloud
TODO: 
This paragraph block should be an introduction to the submodule. Are there any prerequisites the user must perform to begin the workshop? Do they need to sign up for any external accounts or install any tools? An example of content guidance can be found at the bottom of this page.
