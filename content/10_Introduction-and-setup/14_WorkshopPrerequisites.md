# Workshop Prerequisites
We'll need to setup the following:

- Snyk Account
- Snyk CLI


## Snyk Account and Snyk CLI
Your Snyk account allows you to scan your code to see results locally or on the Snyk website.  In this workshop we'll use both the CLI and Web App.  You have the additional options of running Snyk within popular IDEs or programmatically with API calls, but those are not covered in this workshop.
