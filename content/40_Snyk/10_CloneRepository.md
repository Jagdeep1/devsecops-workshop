## Clone the repository

Let's start by cloning this public repository from GitHub.  In your working environment, run these commands to start from your home directory and perform a clone of the repository:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/gautambaghel/vulnerable-ec2
cd vulnerable-ec2
```

In this repository, we'll scan and review the results of the IaC project and make local changes to see how a developer would fix issues at the environment.

You will be asked to make and commit changes to the code in a later module.  We'll provide instructions at that time about creating a fork under your GitHub ID.
