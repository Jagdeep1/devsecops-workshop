# Snyk 

In this first module, we get the code and run some CLI operations with Snyk to find misconfigurations in your Infrastructure as Code definitions.

We will perform these operations:

* Clone the respository
* Run a Snyk CLI scan and then fix an issue locally
* Send results to the Snyk Website
